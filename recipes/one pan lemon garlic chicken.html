            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>A quick and easy dinner for the family suitable for every night ove the week</p>
            <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or any herb blend</li>
        <li>1/2 tp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tp garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1tbs olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cp chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 lb asparagus, ends trimmed cut into 1 1/2-in pieces</li>
        <li>1 tbs minced garlic,or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 tbs minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry and trim any excess fat.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Season both sides of chicken thighs with herb mixture.</li>
        <li>In a large, nonstick skillet, heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. When oil is hot and butter is melted, add chicken in a single layer and brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the skillet, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to a boil. Boil until broth is reduced in volume by half, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add asparagus and cook, stirring occasionally, until asparagus is a deep, bright green color, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>To the asparagus, add fresh garlic and lemon juice and cook about 1 minute. Add butter, one tablespoon at a time. Stir quickly, until each pat is fully melted, before adding another.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet, nestling the pieces down into the sauce and asparagus. Sprinkle with minced parsley and cook until the internal temperature of chicken, measured with an instant-read thermometer, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over the chicken thighs to serve, and garnish with lemon slices. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
